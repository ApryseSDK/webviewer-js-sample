# WebViewer - JS Sample

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs, MS Office, videos, images, and CAD that can be embedded into any web project.

This repo is specifically designed for any users interested in integrating WebViewer into a vanilla JS project.

## Demo

You can explore all of the functionality in our [showcase](https://www.pdftron.com/webviewer/demo/).

## Initial Setup

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes [Node.js and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).


1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. IDE used in this sample is Visual Studio Code with an NPM extension to process commands within its terminal.
3. [GitHub command line](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) `git`.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/PDFTron/webviewer-js-sample.git
cd webviewer-js-sample
npm install
```

`npm install` gets and installs required dependencies. Make sure `.parcelrc` is available at the root and configured as below.

```
{
  "extends": "@parcel/config-default",
  "reporters": [
    "...",
    "parcel-reporter-multiple-static-file-copier"
  ]
}
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

After the app starts, you will be able to see a WebViewer running on `localhost:1234`.

## Static Resources

`WebViewer` requires static resources created in the `dist` folder. Make sure the `origin` and `destination` are specified as below in the `package.json`.

```
  "multipleStaticFileCopier": [
    {
      "origin": "node_modules/@pdftron/webviewer/public",
      "destination": "dist/public/webviewer"
    }
  ]
```

The `package.json` file contains the `start` and `build` scripts. The only script to call is the `start` to run the app out-of-the-box.   

```
    "start": "parcel index.html --open http://localhost:1234"
```
